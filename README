At SIGCSE a year or two ago, Brian Harvey looked at my work on the
MediaScripting project and said (approximately): "Sam, you have a
variety of models of images, which is good in some respects, but
bad in others.  Can't you merge all of them so that they can be
combined in the 'Drawings as Images' model?"

This project is my exploration of Brian's question.

Right now, the project is designed to be run primarily in 
MediaScheme/GIMP.  I will explore other ways to use it soon.
